# Food API

#### A small api I've created to get familiar with Java as a Web-Backend in combination with Spring Boot.

## About

A few years ago, I tracked every purchase I've made that was related to food or drinks.

First I created a website with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP which sent the data to a MySQL database over a simple form. For this I had to input every item on every receipt during the time of the project.

Now I've put all these data into a new database and made it accessible over an api.

For more information regarding the food journal, [please see my Angular project](https://food-journal.netlify.app/#/).
